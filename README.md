# Airbnb Analytics
In this project I used DBT Cloud to transform Airbnb listings, hosts and reviews data in berlin, and create a datawarehouse on Snowflake. 

# Data
The data was extracted from https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/. \
The data extracted includes the following tables:
- listings
- hosts
- reviews
  
while the full moon dates table wasn't extracted from the airbnb data \

these table have the following schema\
